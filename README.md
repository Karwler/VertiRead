A so far simple cross-platform manga reader and music player.
Still in progress.

TO DO
- fix exit button reacts only on 2nd click (linux)
- scene resize instead of recreating all objects
- make the actual reader
- make a playlist editor
- improve vector classes
- add settings menu lists
- improve exception handling
- give it a proper look
- maybe add some animations
- optimize it somehow

LINUX
Qt project file is configured for Linux only.
All dependencies need to be installed manually. The project file contains all needed linker flags.

WINDOWS
Project files were created with MS Visual Studio 2015.
All libraries are already included and linked in the project.
