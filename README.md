A so far simple cross-platform manga reader and music player.
Still in progress.

TO DO
- make dragable scrollbars
- fix rect cropping in lists
- make the actual reader
- add settings menu lists
- give it a proper look
- maybe replace boost with something faster
- maybe add some animations
- write comments
- optimize it somehow

LINUX
No project files yet. (I'll add them soon)
All dependencies need to be installed manually. The project file will contain all the needed linker flags.

WINDOWS
All project files were created with MS Visual Studio 2015.
All SDL libraries are already included and linked in the project.
The boost_filesystem library isn't included so it needs to be linked manually. (no linker flags needed)
